# mTLS

Code from [A step by step guide to mTLS in Go][1]

Certificates generated via the very helpful [FiloSottile/mkcert][2]
project, though done so in a container to avoid installing a fake root CA
onto the host. (This is insecure and should be done so with extreme caution.)

To generate a root CA and two distinct certificate pairs (for two different
services running on `localhost`):

```
./_bin/generate-tls-certs.sh
```

## Running on Host

In one shell:

```
go run cmd/server/main.go \
  ./docker/tls-certs/rootCA-cert.pem  \
  ./docker/tls-certs/localhost-server-cert.pem \
  ./docker/tls-certs/localhost-server-key.pem
```

and in another

```
go run cmd/client/main.go \
  ./docker/tls-certs/rootCA-cert.pem  \
  ./docker/tls-certs/localhost-client-cert.pem \
  ./docker/tls-certs/localhost-client-key.pem
```

## Running via `docker-compose`

To run both the client and server at once:

```
docker-compose \
  --file docker/docker-compose.yml \
  up \
  --build \
  --force-recreate \
  --abort-on-container-exit \
  --exit-code-from=server \
  --remove-orphans
```

This should produce output similar to:

```
...

```

To clean up:

```
docker-compose \
  --file docker/docker-compose.yml \
  down
```

https://redflagsecurity.net/2019/03/10/decrypting-tls-wireshark/ <-- uses `sslkeylog.log` to get session keys to decrypt
Also added `localhost-server-key.pem` as an RSA key to the SSL protocol with `http` as the interceptor

To "automatically" modify SSL protocol settings:

$ /bin/cat ~/.config/wireshark/rsa_keys
# This file is automatically generated, DO NOT MODIFY.
"/Users/dhermes/workspace/mtls-explainer/docker/tls-certs/localhost-server-key.pem",""
$
$ /bin/cat ~/.config/wireshark/ssl_keys
# This file is automatically generated, DO NOT MODIFY.
"127.0.0.1","8443","http","/Users/dhermes/workspace/mtls-explainer/docker/tls-certs/localhost-server-key.pem",""
$
$ /bin/cat ~/.config/wireshark/preferences | grep -A 5 -B 5 'tls\.keylog_file'
# <MS> = The Master-Secret (MS)
# <CRAND> = The Client's random number from the ClientHello message

# Whether the TNS dissector should reassemble messages spanning multiple TCP segments. To use this option, you must also enable "Allow subdissectors to reassemble TCP streams" in the TCP protocol settings.
